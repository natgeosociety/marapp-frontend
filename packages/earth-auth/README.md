# Earth Auth

Custom screens for auth0

## Setup

Available commands:

| Command                   | Description                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| yarn start                | Start development server.      |
| yarn build                | Compile TypeScript resources.  |

## Running

Create a local `.env` and `.env.local` file based on [.env.sample](.env.sample), add the required configuration for the environment. 

The following environment variables are required by the application.

| **Key** | **Description** |
| ------------- |:----------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Node.js environment (e.g. `development`, `production`) |
| `APP_TERMS_OF_SERVICE` | the link for terms of service |
| `APP_PRIVACY_POLICY` | the link for privacy policy |
| `APP_NAME` | app name |
| `APP_ATOB` | the encoded data from auth0 |

APP_ATOB is specified from auth0. When developing locally, you can specify an atob in the env config, so that you can run the screens locally. 

Due to the file size of the generated html being to high, all external dependencies are linked with script tags in the html head.
